  "Use the following guidelines to determine what kinds of defensibility a startup can build with time:\n\
- **Network effect**: When every user creates more value for other users, forming a positive feedback loop. This can be local or global, and is one of the few forms of defensibility that can arise immediately upon launch of a company.\n\
- **Platform effect**: When a company becomes a sticky product because so many other companies have integrated against it. This usually comes after a company has enough users that others want to build against its platform to reach them.\n\
- **Integrations**: When a company integrates against many other APIs, code bases, etc. that are hard to reproduce, or when a company's services do integrations for the company against other vendors. This makes it hard to displace the company as each implementation is a unique and complex process.\n\
- **Building a ton of stuff**: When a company bundles and cross sells products that prevent other companies from finding a wedge to compete with them, or when a company has a big product footprint that makes it hard for new entrants to reach feature parity.\n\
- **Deals**: When a company secures early access, exclusive provider or distribution, or backend deals that give it scale, brand, or access advantages over competitors. This may include deals with APIs, data sources, regulators, or customers.\n\
- **Sales as moat**: When a company locks in customers with long term contracts, or has a sales process that makes it easier for enterprises to buy from them than from new suppliers. This may include security reviews, procurement processes, or pricing strategies.\n\
- **Regulatory**: When a company receives regulatory approvals that provide a moat. This may include licenses, permits, or exemptions that are hard to obtain or replicate by competitors.\n\
- **Data or system of record effect**: When a company has unique or proprietary data, or owns a customer's data or has a long historical record of it. This can create defensibility by making the data more valuable and harder to switch away from. Similarly, being a system of record for a user, entity, etc. can be a powerful position to be in.\n\
- **Scale effects**: When a company has access to large sums of money or business volume that allows it to do things that will make it difficult for competitors to upend them. This may include capital scale, business scale and negotiation, or pricing advantages.\n\
- **Open source**: When a company benefits from being the creator or contributor of an open source software project that is widely used or adopted by developers. This can create defensibility by giving the company brand recognition, community influence, and talent access.\n\
- **Brand**: When a company becomes synonymous with the thing they do, often by creating a new product category, or doing something vastly better than competitors. This can create defensibility by making the company the default choice for customers and creating loyalty and trust.\n\
- **IP moat**: When a company has intellectual property that protects its product or technology from being copied or infringed by competitors. This tends to be more effective in hard tech or biotech companies than most consumer or SaaS products.\n\
- **Speed**: When a company can execute faster and better than competitors, especially incumbents. This can create defensibility by allowing the company to iterate quickly, respond to customer feedback, and hire and close candidates faster.\n\
- **Pricing**: When a company can offer a lower price than competitors due to a lower cost structure, a lack of an existing product to cannibalize, or a different business model. This can create defensibility by attracting more customers and creating higher margins.\n\
- **New business models**: When a company can innovate on business model to create a higher leverage business or different incentive structure. This can create defensibility by disrupting incumbents who are used to traditional ways of doing things.\nAlways think step by step!";
